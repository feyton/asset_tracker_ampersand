#### Answer 1 Overview

## The Problem
1. Design and implement a system that will track the assets in motion. Battery Swap, telematics onboard. 
2. How would you organize the data? What technologies would you use? Where would you see key risks?

## Overview
Ampersand needs to track the usage of each battery in order to accurately bill the drivers for the energy used. This would likely involve assigning unique identifiers to each battery, as well as tracking information such as the date and time of each swap, the identity of the driver, and the location of the swap station. This information could be collected using a variety of methods, such as RFID tags on the batteries. The data could then be stored in a database or other system for tracking and billing purposes.
Additionally, this data can also be used to monitor the condition of the batteries and to predict when they need to be replaced, to ensure a seamless service to the drivers.

## System design
The design and implementation involves some key components.

1. **Asset tracking devices**: To track the assets in motion, the electric motorcycles and their batteries will need to be equipped with tracking devices. These devices can include GPS trackers, RFID tags, or other types of telematics devices.
2. **Communication infrastructure**: The tracking devices will need to communicate with a central system in order to transmit their location and other data. This can be done using cellular or satellite networks, or other types of wireless communication methods.
3. **Data storage and management**: The data collected from the tracking devices will need to be stored and managed in a central location. This can be done using a database or other data storage system and can include options for real-time data tracking, historical data analytics, and data visualization.
4. **User interface**: A user interface will be needed to allow authorized personnel to access the data and view the location of the assets in real-time, as well as to track the battery swap, usage, and billing. This can be a web-based or mobile application, or desktop software.
5. **Battery Telemetry**: The battery telemetry system can be integrated with the asset tracking system to provide real-time data on the battery's usage, state of health, temperature, and other relevant information.

#### A good addition

6. **Billing and Payment integration:**
The system can be integrated with a billing and payment gateway to bill the drivers for the energy used and provide options for payment or even integration with a payment gateway for online payment like Mobile Money or Airtel Money Rwanda.


## How would you organize the data?
Organizing the data will involve many aspects but the key note is that the majority of data to be collected will be * Unstructured data* with the likes of:
- Driver location
- Battery usage and others

This means a combination of different methods and given the fact that a focus would be on scalability and reliability of the system.

A combination of:
1. Relational Database (PostgreSQL) which store data in tables and enforce relationship would be ideal and
2. MongoDB (NoSQL Database): would be used to store our unstructured data due to its high performance
3. Redis: An in-memory data structure store has been proven to be reliable and fast. This would be used for caching and storing live location data for fast querying

The following models/schemas would be needed (Note that this is not finite and can be updated as demand changes):

**Asset tracking data:**
> This would include information such as the location, speed, and direction of the electric motorcycles and the batteries

```js
Asset ID (unique identifier for the motorcycle or battery)
Timestamp
GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
Speed
Direction
Battery level
```
**Battery usage data**
```js
Asset ID (unique identifier for the battery)
Timestamp
Energy usage (in watt-hours)
State of Health (SOH)
Temperature
```

**Driver information:**
```js
Driver ID (unique identifier for the driver)
Driver name
Contact information (phone number, email address)
Billing information (prepaid or postpaid, credit card details)
```

**Station information:**
```js
Station ID (unique identifier for the swap station)
Station location (address, GPS coordinates)
```
**Billing data:** 
>This would include information on the billing for the energy used by the batteries.

```js
Asset ID (unique identifier for the battery)
Timestamp
Energy usage (in watt-hours)
Cost (in dollars or Rwf)
```

**Event logs:** 
>This would include information on events such as battery swap, and telemetry events

```js
Asset ID (unique identifier for the motorcycle or battery)
Timestamp
Event Type (swap, telemetry)
Event Description (battery swap at station, telemetry data transmission)
```


## What technologies would I use
The following no-exhaustive list highlight some key technologies that would be used to design such system:

1. Tracking devices: GPS or RFID Tags would play a great role. Accuracy needs to be highly prioritized to ensure that these data can be acted on hence the choice in technologies
2. Central server to collect and organize the data from trackers
3. Data storage would be PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis
4. UI: A web application for the administrators and a mobile app for Drivers and Station managers

To ensure the scalability and reliability of the system, I would host the system on *AWS or Microsoft Azure* to ensure that we have an on-demand scaling ability as we grow customer base

## Where are the risks
There are several key risks that could arise when implementing a system to track assets in motion like this. Key in point is multiple stakeholders involved in the system. The following would be the source of risks to be taken into consideration

1. Data security
> The system will handle sensitive information such as driver and billing information, and it's important to ensure that this data is secure. Risks include unauthorized access to the data, data breaches, and data loss.

2. Data accuracy
> The system must be able to accurately track the location and usage of the assets in real-time, and to ensure the accuracy of the data, it is important to validate the data received from the tracking devices and to handle errors and inconsistencies. The system can learn overtime to correct the errors and improve accrodingly but the accuracy aspect should be considered highly from the technologies to be used.

3. Privacy
> The system will also collect data on the driver's location and usage, which can raise privacy concerns. It's important to ensure that the data is collected and used in compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations.

4. System scalability
> The system must be reliable and available to ensure that the data is always accessible and that the assets can be tracked in real time. Risks include system failures, network outages, and other types of disruptions that may arise over time. 

5. Scalability
> As the number of assets and the usage of the system increases, the system must be able to scale to handle the increased load. Risks include system slowdown or downtime due to lack of scalability. Hence the recommend usage of cloud services to gurantee on demand scalability

The other risks would arise due to third-party services like *Payment Gateway*

`It is important to identify and mitigate these risks as part of the system design and implementation process. This can involve implementing security measures such as encryption and access controls, testing and validation of data and system performance, and regular monitoring and maintenance of the system.`
