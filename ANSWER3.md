#### Answer for question 3 of assessment

## The problem
What's a good way to predict and optimize for how many batteries should be at a given station?

## Overview
Tp predict the number of batteries would need availability of extensive data that has been collected over time. Since the system would be collecting the traffick at stations and drivers location, the following would play in favor:

1. Historical data analysis: By analyzing historical data on battery swaps and usage patterns, it is possible to identify patterns in the demand for battery swaps and to predict how many batteries will be needed at a given station in the future.

2. Machine Learning: Using Machine Learning techniques can help to predict the demand for battery swaps, and optimize the number of batteries at a given station.

3. Simulation: A simulation model can be built to model the usage patterns of the electric motorcycles, and to predict the demand for battery swaps. This simulation model can be used to optimize the number of batteries at a given station by simulating different scenarios and identifying the demand
